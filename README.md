Geometry constraint solver of SolveSpace as a Python library

The solver has been written by Jonathan Westhues. You can find more information
[on his page][solvespace-lib]. It is part of [SOLVESPACE][solvespace-cad], which
is a parametric 3d CAD program.

My contributions:

* making it work on Linux (only the library, not the whole program!)
* Python wrapper

I'm going to use the Python library with [SolidPython][solidpython], so I have a
constraint solver for [OpenSCAD][openscad].
